            <h2>What actually is Universe</h2>

            <p>The universe is everything. All of space,
                 time, matter, and energy. It includes 
                 galaxies swirling in elegant spirals, 
                 stars blazing with unimaginable heat, 
                 planets both barren and teeming with 
                 lifeâ€”and the invisible threads of dark 
                 matter and dark energy that shape it all.</p>

            <p>According to modern science, the universe began about 13.8
            billion years ago with the Big Bang, a moment when space
            itself began expanding. Since then, it's grown into the vast,
            dynamic cosmos we observe today. It has no known edge, no confirmed 
            center, and possibly no end. Just galaxies upon galaxies, all dancing
             to the laws of physics.</p>
