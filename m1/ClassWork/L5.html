                <p>
                    The term “universe” refers to an unimaginably vast space that is
                    unbounded by its dots of bodies. By definition, the universe 
                    includes everything that abounds in space, and space is filled
                    with matter ranging from the tiniest and cosmic particle to the
                    most massive galaxies. The universe is known to be made up of
                    many different types of comparatively small and large dense 
                    Bodies, such as galaxies, constellations (star groups), stars,
                    planets, and other heavenly bodies. From grand galaxies to cosmic
                    dust filling infinite space, the totality of heavenly bodies describes 
                    the universe whose dimension is beyond our imagination.

                    The Universe is astounding. Put it this way: all of its ordinary matter,
                    all the particles that make us and everything we can see only make up 4%
                    of its matter.We only discovered the Universes major mass component, the
                     thing that makes up 70% of it, in 1998.We call it dark energy  although 
                     nobody has the slightest idea what exactly it is.
