            <h2>All about Basketball</h2>
            <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each,
             opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of
             shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the 
             defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m)
             high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team
             from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made
             from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play 
             stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one,
             two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the
             game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period
             of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

        <aside>
            <p>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by
             passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense,
             players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense,
             they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense
             or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. 
             It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, 
             or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</p>
