        <h2>Inside Triyog</h2>
        <p>Established in 1987, Triyog High School, is a school with a rich tradition of excellence. Originally a premier girls' school, it became co-educational in 1998,
         with the aim of providing quality education that promotes the development of the mind, body, and spirit. Despite starting with just 27 students and 6 teachers,
          Triyog has now grown to over 1,100 students and 180 teachers and staff. The first batch of 40 students graduated in 1995, and since then, over 2000 Triyogees
           have graduated with high to outstanding marks, with alumni succeeding in their studies, careers, and lives all over the world.</p>

         <p>In 2005, the School moved from Battisputali to its own state-of-the-art infrastructure in Dhapasi, Kathmandu, providing an environment most conducive to learning and teaching.
         By 2013, Triyog had also started the 10+2 program in its premises. Additionally, in 2012, Triyog introduced Progressive-Integrated Teaching-Learning from Grade I,
          which has since extended up to the middle school. This practice emphasizes experiential and hands-on learning, with children at the center and teachers serving as facilitators.</p>
