    <b>Benifits of Coding.</b><br>


    <blockquote cite="https://potomac.edu/benefits-of-coding/">
        There was a time when most things related to computers—anything more complicated than messaging your friends—were considered geek territory. But naturally, with the advancement of technology, computer science, coding became widely popular. And it’s still going strong. So if you are still wondering if it will be worth your while to learn how to code, consider the impact technology has made on our daily lives, let alone its impact on education, medicine, science, etc.

Benefits of Coding
Whether you are considering learning to code to enter a coding career or simply as a hobby, there are a number of benefits to it. Mastering coding skills equips you with quite a few skills, most of which are also widely applicable in industries outside of coding. To better demonstrate the benefits of coding, we have prepared a list of 10 reasons why you should learn how to code. Well then, let’s dive in!

1. You’ll Be Eligible to Apply for Coding Jobs
We can easily say this particular benefit is the reward that one gets upon mastering the coding skills. It’s common knowledge that not everybody can land a job that involves some programming level without at least being familiar with this field. However, one doesn’t have to be a coding expert to get an entry-level job in this field.

You should keep in mind that the level of coding you need to have depends entirely on the kind of job you choose. Some require a higher knowledge level than others. Not all the careers in computer science and IT fields are the same. Consequently, employers may have different requirements for prospective employees.

2. You’ll Get to Create a Portfolio that Stands Out From the Rest
We already know that each year, the job market becomes more and more competitive. So, for a job candidate to get a certain position among hundreds of others, they have to show that they are the ones that they deserve it. How do they do it? Well, you start by creating a CV or a portfolio that not too many people have.

In the journey towards mastering coding skills, one tries multiple things in order to practice the things they’re learning. You can easily add these little “projects” to your resume and showcase the work you’ve done over the months (even over the years). Through these projects, you show the employer that you have the knowledge and the technical skills that a candidate needs to work in a coding job environment.
